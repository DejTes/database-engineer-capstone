## Introducton to Advanced Data Modeling
 - A data model visually represents data elements and their relationships, helping to understand how data is stored, accessed, and updated within a database.
 - It ensures a consistent structure and high-quality data, particularly in entity relational databases, which are often planned using entity relationship diagrams.

 Levels of Data Models"
- **Conceptual Data Model**: High-level, static business structures and concepts.
    - Provides a high-level overview of the database system, presenting entities (like customers, products, and orders) and their relationships.
- **Logical Data Model**: Entity types, data attributes, and relationships.
    - Builds on the conceptual model by detailing entities, their attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys, creating a more structured representation.
- **Physical Data Model**: Database-specific implementation details.
    - Translates the logical model into a technical schema, including tables, columns, data types, and constraints, tailored to the database management system.

NB:  Data modeling is inherently a top-down process, starting with the conceptual model to establish the overall vision, then proceeding to the logical model, and finally the detailed design contained in the physical model

### Types Of Data Models
- **Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model)**: Represents entities and their relationships.
    - is typically represented using entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), which visually depict entities, attributes, and relationships.
    - Entities are objects or concepts, such as customers or products, while relationships describe interactions between entities, like a customer placing an order.

- **The Hierarchical data Model**: Organizes data in a tree-like structure, with parent-child relationships represented by pointers.
    - Each parent can have multiple children, but each child has only one parent.
    - This model is useful for representing one-to-many relationships, like a department with multiple employees.

- **The Object-oriented data model**: Represents data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming.
    - Objects contain data (attributes) and methods (functions), and can inherit from other objects.
    - This model is useful for complex data structures, like multimedia files or geographic information systems.

    - Forward Engineering: Translates a data model into a physical database schema.
    - Reverse Engineering: Generates a data model from an existing database schema.


## Data Warehousing
- is a centralized repository that aggregates, stores, and processes large amounts of data from multiple sources, allowing for data analysis and reporting.
- Data warehouses are typically used for business intelligence (BI) and decision-making, providing insights into historical and current data trends.

Key Characteristics of Data Warehouses:
- **Subject-Oriented**: Organized around key business subjects, like sales, customers, or products.
- **Integrated**: Combines data from multiple sources, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Time-Variant**: Stores historical data for analysis and comparison over time.
- **Non-Volatile**: Data is read-only and does not change once stored, ensuring data integrity.

Types of Data Warehouses:
- **structured data**: Data that is organized into a tabular format with rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.
- **unstructured data**: Data that does not have a predefined structure, like text documents, images, or videos.

## Datawarehouse Architecture:
The design of the data warehouse's various components.
- data sources: The systems that provide data to the warehouse, such as transactional databases, CRM systems, or external sources.
- Data Staging: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Processes that extract data from source systems, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into the data warehouse.
- Data Warehouse: The central repository that stores and manages data for analysis and reporting.
- Data Marts: Subsets of the data warehouse that focus on specific business areas or departments.
- Data anlytics: Tools and techniques used to analyze data and extract insights, such as OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) or data mining.
- Presentation Layer: The interface that allows users to access and interact with the data warehouse, such as dashboards or reports.

Data warehouse architiecture practices:
- Separate analytical and transactional systems: Keep the data warehouse separate from transactional systems to avoid performance issues and ensure data integrity.
- use scalable solutions to process large volumes of data.
- Build a flexible architecture that can adapt to changing business needs and data sources.

# Dimensional Data Modeling
- Dimensional data modeling is a technique used in data warehousing to organize and structure data for analysis and reporting.
- it focuses on the usability and performance of queries in a data warehouse and is widely used for analytical purposes.

### Key Concepts of Dimensional Data Modeling

1. **Fact Table**
   - A fact table stores quantitative data (measurable metrics or facts) for analysis.
   - Examples: Sales amount, quantity sold, revenue, profit.
   - Columns:
     - **Foreign Keys**: Reference dimension tables (e.g., Product ID, Date ID).
     - **Measures/Facts**: Numerical values (e.g., sales revenue, total cost).

2. **Dimension Tables**
   - Dimension tables store descriptive, textual data that provide context for the facts.
   - Examples: Customer, Product, Time, Location.
   - Columns:
     - **Attributes**: Descriptive fields (e.g., Product Name, Customer Name, Year, Region).

3. **Star Schema**
   - A simple and common dimensional modeling approach.
   - Structure: A central fact table linked to multiple dimension tables.
   - Advantage: Easy to understand and query.

   Example:
   ```
                 Time Dimension
                      |
   Customer Dimension - Fact Table - Product Dimension
                      |
               Location Dimension
   ```

4. **Snowflake Schema**
   - An extension of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.
   - Advantage: Reduces redundancy.
   - Disadvantage: Slightly more complex queries.

5. **Grain**
   - Grain defines the level of detail represented by the fact table.
   - Example: Sales per day, per product, per store.

6. **Measures**
   - Aggregated data in the fact table.
   - Examples: Sum, average, count, min, max of sales, revenue, or profits.

7. **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)**
   - Tracks changes in dimension attributes over time.
   - Types:
     - **Type 1:** Overwrite the old value.
     - **Type 2:** Create a new row for each change.
     - **Type 3:** Add a new column for the previous value.

### **Steps to Build Dimensional Data Models**
1. **Identify Business Requirements**
   - Understand the KPIs, metrics, and reporting needs.
2. **Determine the Grain**
   - Decide the level of detail for the data.
3. **Identify Dimensions**
   - Define the descriptive data (e.g., customers, products, time).
4. **Identify Facts**
   - Determine the metrics to measure (e.g., sales revenue, profit).
5. **Design the Schema**
   - Create the star or snowflake schema.
6. **ETL Process**
   - Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) data into the fact and dimension tables.

### **Advantages of Dimensional Data Modeling**
1. **Improved Query Performance:** Designed for faster data retrieval.
2. **Simplicity:** Easy for business users to understand.
3. **Flexibility:** Enables slicing and dicing data for analysis.
4. **Scalability:** Can handle large datasets effectively.

### **Use Case Example: E-Commerce**
- **Fact Table:** Sales Fact
  - Facts: Revenue, Quantity Sold, Discount.
  - Foreign Keys: Product ID, Date ID, Customer ID.
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - **Product Dimension:** Product ID, Name, Category, Price.
  - **Customer Dimension:** Customer ID, Name, Age, Region.
  - **Time Dimension:** Date ID, Day, Month, Quarter, Year.

# Introduction to Data Analytics
- Data analytics is the process of analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data to extract insights and make informed decisions.
- It involves applying statistical, mathematical, and computational techniques to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in data.

 Types of Data Analytics

- Descriptive: Presents data in a descriptive format.
- Exploratory: Establishes relationships between variables.
- Inferential: Makes inferences from a small sample.
- Predictive: Identifies patterns to predict future performance.
- Causal: Explores cause and effect relationships.

Types of Data:
