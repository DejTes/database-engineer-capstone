## Introducton to Advanced Data Modeling
 - A data model visually represents data elements and their relationships, helping to understand how data is stored, accessed, and updated within a database.
 - It ensures a consistent structure and high-quality data, particularly in entity relational databases, which are often planned using entity relationship diagrams.

 Levels of Data Models"
    - **Conceptual Data Model**: High-level, static business structures and concepts.
        - Provides a high-level overview of the database system, presenting entities (like customers, products, and orders) and their relationships.
    - **Logical Data Model**: Entity types, data attributes, and relationships.
        - Builds on the conceptual model by detailing entities, their attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys, creating a more structured representation.
    - **Physical Data Model**: Database-specific implementation details.
        - Translates the logical model into a technical schema, including tables, columns, data types, and constraints, tailored to the database management system.
